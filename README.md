# Task-Manager
this is My First Project on web dev Task Manager Built using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT and we use a Local Storage for Storing the data

if you want to watch the local storage in real-time and what is happening inside, these are the following stages you can do-

I used visual-studio codes as my integrated development environment (IDE) and run the code in the Chrome browser so I am giving instructions based on what I've used

# steps to locate the local storage in the browser
1. run the index.html file through any ide in the Chrome browser
2. after the project is open inspect the page and in the Element section find the application
3. inside the application go to the local storage > (HTTP://(a.b.c.d:abcd) this is where your key-value pair is located in the JSON format

   now if any changes happen you can locate them in the above section

if you can't able to see any changes or your local host is not present you can do the following steps-

# steps to host the local server
1. open the terminal or command prompt
2. go to the folder where the project is located through the terminal
3. there you can type the command "npx serve ."
4. now you can see that the server is hosting
5. go back to the "steps to locate the local storage in the browser" section and follow the instructions
